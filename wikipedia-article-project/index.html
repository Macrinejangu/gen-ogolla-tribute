        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI is found in applications like virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The field of AI was formally founded in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College. Early efforts focused on symbolic reasoning and logic. After periods of progress and setbacks (known as AI winters), the field has seen rapid growth in the 2010s and 2020s, driven by advances in machine learning and computing power.</p>

    <section id="applications">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>AI is used in many areas including healthcare (diagnostic tools), finance (fraud detection), marketing (chatbots and targeting), and transportation (self-driving cars). Popular tools include ChatGPT, Siri, Google Assistant, and facial recognition software.</p>

    <section id="ethics">
        <h2>Ethics</h2>
        <p>As AI grows, concerns about bias, privacy, job displacement, and decision transparency increase. Ethical AI development aims to ensure technology benefits society and doesn't reinforce existing inequalities or cause harm.</p>
